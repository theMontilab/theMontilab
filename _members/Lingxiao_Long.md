Lingxiao is a Master student in the Monti Lab, with a background in biomedical and synthetic chemistry. She completed her undergraduate studies at Tiangong University in China, where she focused on the synthesis of liver cancer-targeted drugs. Currently, her research centers on DNA-targeted drug discovery, aiming to identify G-quadruplex (G4) structures within the unique DNA sequences of Trypanosomes. By characterizing these structures, she hopes to develop new molecular targets for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis.
