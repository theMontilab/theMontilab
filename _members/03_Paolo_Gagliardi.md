Paolo is a PhD candidate working on the design and synthesis of small-molecule therapeutic agents to improve treatments against negkected tropical diseases caused by parasitic infections. 
He earned a BSc in Chemistry from the University of Perugia (Italy) in 2022, followed by an MSci in Chemistry at the University of Melbourne in 2024 under Prof. Spencer Williams, where his research focused on key organosulfur compounds found in nature. This work introduced Paolo to synthetic methods and provided him with experience in elucidating catabolic pathways in bacteria.
Paolo is passionate about applying chemistry to real-world challenges and aims to advance our understanding of under-researched parasitic infections through his research.
