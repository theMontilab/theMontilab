Minghui is a PhD student in the Monti Lab with a background in molecular biology and a strong interest in drug discovery. She obtained her BSc in Chemistry through the 2+2 double degree program between the University of Edinburgh and East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). She then pursued a Master of Research in Drug Discovery and Development at Imperial College London, where her work focused on protein biochemistry and nucleic acid biology. After graduating with distinction, Minghui continued her research training with an internship at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, which further deepened her interest in drug discovery.
Her current PhD research focuses on the biological role of unique DNA structures in parasitic genomes, with the aim of uncovering their potential as novel therapeutic targets.
